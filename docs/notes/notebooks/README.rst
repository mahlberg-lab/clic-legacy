These notebooks document important parts of the toolkit used in
the project. To open them make sure that ipython and its
dependencies are installed. Then cd in the notebooks dir and
hit `ipython notebook`. 

The notebooks can be exported to html using the command

    ipython nbconvert name-of-the-notebook.ipynb

It is possible that one has to install several dependencies for this
command to work (for instance, `pip install pygments` and
`sudo apt-get install pandoc`). Pygments might have to be installed
globally as well (`sudo apt-get install python-pygments`).
