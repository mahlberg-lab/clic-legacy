CLiC: A corpus tool to support the analysis of literary texts
=============================================================

The CLiC Dickens project demonstrates through corpus stylistics how computer-assisted methods can be used to study literary texts and lead to new insights into how readers perceive fictional characters. As part of the project we are developing the web app CLiC, designed specifically for the analysis of literary texts. CLiC Dickens started at the University of Nottingham in 2013, it is now a collaborative project with the University of Birmingham.
